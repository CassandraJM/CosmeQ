# CosmeQ
This web app scans ingredients through text detection or text matching and communicates with API calls to Google Vision for OCR Detection to detect the ingredients found in cosmetic products as well as analyze the ingredient's specific risk score, whether it is harmful to the skin. Users may use this app to determine which cosmetic products are safest to use.
